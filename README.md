Cast Statistics [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/innovate-technologies/Cast-Statistics.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/innovate-technologies/Cast-Statistics)
===============
This is a plugin written for [Cast](https://github.com/Innovate-Technologies/Cast) that interacts with [ITFrame](https://github.com/Innovate-Technologies/ITFrame) to log listener sessions in a database and calculate the statistics.

To distribute the computer power the math is being done inside the Cast process, ITFrame acts as a backend for storage and forwarding the info to the outside only.

This is still very much a work in progress and needs improvement!
